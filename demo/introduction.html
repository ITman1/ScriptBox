            These pages are related to the project <a href="https://github.com/ITman1/ScriptBox">ScriptBox</a>
            which aims the adding of scripting support for (X)HTML documents. Project was developed as part
            of master's thesis on the Faculty of Information Technology, Brno University of Technology.
            Origin goal of creating this project was to add the scripting support into 
            <a href="http://cssbox.sourceforge.net/">CSSBox project</a>, but complete design of the user agent
            allowed to create library that is independent from the mentioned project. Now are released two versions 
            of the library. First version is fully independent from the <a href="http://cssbox.sourceforge.net/">CSSBox project</a>
            and allows simple browsing the pages without user interface. Second version uses components from the
            <a href="http://cssbox.sourceforge.net/">CSSBox project</a> that renders the (X)HTML pages and makes
            them browsable using the simple user interface. 
        </p>
        <p>    
            The implementation was written in Java and follows the 
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/Overview.html">editorial draft</a>
            of the HTML 5.1 specification. Libraries and corresponding source code can be downloaded
            from the Github repository <a href="https://github.com/ITman1/ScriptBox">pages</a>.
